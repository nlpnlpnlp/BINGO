# 🧩 BINGO: Balanced-in Gradient Optimizer with Directional Guidance and Magnitude Scaling for Self-Explanation Rationalization

This repository contains code for the paper "BINGO: Balanced-in Gradient Optimizer with Directional Guidance and Magnitude Scaling for Self-Explanation Rationalization". We release some key code in experiments. We will release all the code used in experiments upon acceptance. 

 
## 📘 Overview
Self-explanation rationalization typically requires a developed model not only to make accurate predictions but also to generate human-understandable rationales (e.g., sparse and coherent), which is often achieved by optimizing multiple constraint terms jointly. However, to learn human-intelligible rationales, (i) some constraint criteria in rationalization models are often non-causally correlated to the target labels; and (ii) different conditional constraints are difficult to coordinate. To address this problem, we propose a novel optimization method (BINGO) for rationalization, which incorporates gradient directional guidance and magnitude scaling to reconcile the multiple objectives between non-causal criteria and causal constraints. Specifically, to address the issue of non-causal correlations in constraints, we propose a conflict-suppressed and causality-augmented gradient update mechanism to guide the learning of gradient direction. Meanwhile, to balance multi-objective constraints, we introduce a dynamic gradient magnitude scaling strategy that resolves inconsistencies among different objectives. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on six widely used rationalization datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of BINGO and the state-of-the-art performance.

## 🚀 Running example
### Beer-Aroma
Aroma: source run_bingo.sh	

```
aspect=0
sparsity_percentage=0.1
optimizer=BINGO
data_type='beer'
epochs=400
gpu=0
cls_lambda=1.0 
sparsity_lambda=1.0 
continuity_lambda=1.0


log_dir=./new_log/$data_type/'spa'$sparsity_percentage/'as'$aspect/$optimizer
mkdir -p $log_dir
python -u main_bingo.py --hidden_dim 200 --save 0 --dropout 0.2 --lr 0.0001 \
        --data_type beer --batch_size 128 --gpu $gpu --sparsity_percentage $sparsity_percentage \
        --cls_lambda $cls_lambda --sparsity_lambda $sparsity_lambda --continuity_lambda $continuity_lambda --epochs $epochs --aspect 0 \
        --optimizer $optimizer \
        --results_dir $log_dir > $log_dir/cmd1_$sparsity_percentage.log
```

📝 **_Notes_**: "--sparsity_percentage 0.1" means "$s=0.1$" in Sec.3 (But the actual sparsity is different from $s$. When you change the random seed, you need to adjust the "sparsity_percentage" according to the actual sparsity on the test set.). "
--sparsity_lambda 1.0 --continuity_lambda 1.0" means $\lambda_1=1.0, \lambda_2=1.0$. BINGO can automatically learn and adapt these constraints.
"--epochs 400" means we run 400 epochs and take the results when the "dev_acc" is best. 

## 📊 Results
You will get the result like "best_dev_epoch=42" at last. Then you need to find the result corresponding to the epoch with the number "42".  
For Beer-Aroma, you may get a result like: 

Train time for epoch #42 :
