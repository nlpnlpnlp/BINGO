# Datasets used by BINGO

This repository contains the data for the paper "BINGO: Balanced-in Gradient Optimizer with Directional Guidance and Magnitude Scaling for Self-Explanation Rationalization". 
Following previous research (Huang et al., 2021; Yue et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025), we obtain BeerAdvocate and HotelReview datasets.


## benckmarks
- BeerAdvocate. 
- ✅ Beer-Apperance. 
- ✅ Beer-Aroma.
- ✅ Beer-Palate.
- HotelReview. 
- ✅ Hotel-Location.
- ✅ Hotel-Service.
- ✅ Hotel-Cleanliness.


BeerAdvocate and HotelReview are publicly available from existing work (Huang et al., 2021; Yue et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025).
